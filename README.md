# Agriculture Field Pattern Classification using Deep Learning
This project was developed and trained using Google Colaboratory. It uses tensorflow version 2.5.1

The src folder contains the source code.
It contains 5 files:-
1. DCNN_and_VGG16.ipynb - Contains code and output for Deep CNN and VGG 16 Model trained.
2. EfficientNetB0.ipynb - Contains code and output for Efficient Net Model trained.
3. Resnet50final.ipynb - Contains code and output for ResNet50 Model trained.
4. detnet.ipynb - Contains code and output for DetNet Model trained.
5. InceptionV3.ipynb - Contains code and output for InceptionV3 Model trained.

The Sample Dataset conatins 4 folders namely,
weed_cluster, waterway, standing_water and cloud_shadow
corresponding to the field pattern images it contains. Each folder contains 12 images.
